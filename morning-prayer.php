                    DEARLY beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us, in sundry places, to
                    acknowledge and confess our manifold sins and wickedness; and that we
                    should not dissemble nor cloak them before the face of Almighty God our
                    heavenly Father; but confess them with an humble, lowly, penitent, and
                    obedient heart; to the end that we may obtain forgiveness of the same, by
                    his infinite goodness and mercy. And although we ought, at all times,
                    humbly to acknowledge our sins before God; yet ought we chiefly so to do,
                    when we assemble and meet together to render thanks for the great
                    benefits that we have received at his hands, to set forth his most worthy
                    praise, to hear his most holy Word, and to ask those things which are
                    requisite and necessary, as well for the body as the soul. Wherefore I
                    pray and beseech you, as many as are here present, to accompany me with a
                    pure heart, and humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace,

                    <p>
                        <b>
                            I SAID, I will take heed to my ways,
                            * that I offend not in my tongue<br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            I will keep my mouth as it were with a bridle,
                            * while the ungodly is in my sight. <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            I held my tongue, and spake nothing:
                            * I kept silence, yea, even from good words; but it was pain and grief to me. <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            My heart was hot within me: and while I was thus musing the fire kindled,
                            *and at the last I spake with my tongue: <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            LORD, let me know mine end, and the number of my days;
                            * that I may be certified how long I have to live. <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long, and mine age is even as nothing in
                            respect of thee;
                            * and verily every man living is altogether vanity. <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain;
                            * he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them. <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            And now, Lord, what is my hope?
                            * truly my hope is even in thee. <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            Deliver me from all mine offences;
                            * and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish. <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            I became dumb, and opened not my mouth;
                            * for it was thy doing. <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            Take thy plague away from me:
                            * I am even consumed by the means of thy heavy hand. <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            When thou with rebukes dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to consume away,
                            like as it were a moth fretting a garment:
                            * every man therefore is but vanity. <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            Hear my prayer, O LORD, and with thine ears consider my calling;
                            * hold not thy peace at my tears; <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            For I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner,
                            * as all my fathers were. <br/>
                            <small size="-2">&nbsp;<br/></small>
                            O spare me a little, that I may recover my strength,
                            * before I go hence, and be no more seen.

                        <b>
                            And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had
                            inquired at the
                            oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
                            Moreover,
                            Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise
                            and pursue
                            after David this night: And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will
                            make him
                            afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only: And
                            I will bring
                            back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the
                            people shall be in
                            peace. And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. Then said Absalom,
                            Call now
                            Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith. And when Hushai was come to
                            Absalom,
                            Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after
                            his saying?
                            if not; speak thou. And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is
                            not good at
                            this time. For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men,
                            and they be
                            chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man
                            of war, and will
                            not lodge with the people. Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it
                            will come to
                            pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say,
                            There is a
                            slaughter among the people that follow Absalom. And he also that is valiant, whose heart is
                            as the heart
                            of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and
                            they which be with
                            him are valiant men. Therefore, I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee,
                            from Dan even to
                            Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine
                            own person. So
                            shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as
                            the dew
                            falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be
                            left so much as
                            one. Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city,
                            and we will draw it
                            into the river, until there be not one small stone found there. And Absalom and all the men
                            of Israel said,
                            The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the Lord had
                            appointed to
                            defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the Lord might bring evil upon
                            Absalom.
